## 🌊 **Why Does the Sea Recede in Port Dickson?**

One of the fascinating natural phenomena in PD is that after sunset, the sea recedes up to **0.5 – 1 km**, allowing people to walk on the seabed. Then, after sunrise, the sea gradually returns, covering the area again. This occurs due to:

- **Tidal Movements** – The gravitational pull of the moon & sun affects sea levels. 🌙☀️
- **Shallow Coastal Shelf** – The gentle slope of the seabed allows the low tide to extend further. 🏝️
- **Lunar & Seasonal Effects** – Tides are stronger during full moons and certain seasons. 🌕

📌 **Pro Tip:** Wear water shoes and check tide timings before heading out!
