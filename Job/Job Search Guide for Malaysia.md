- In **Malaysia**, salaries are **mostly quoted in thousands per month**.
- Example:
  - In India: **10 LPA (Lakhs Per Annum)**.
  - In Malaysia: **RM 8,000 per month**.
- Always **ask for a reasonable salary** based on your experience and market standards.

  - Your **name** and **current role**.

  - How your **skills align with the job requirements**.
- Keep the email **brief but impactful**, and always attach your **resume and cover letter**.

## Beware of Job Scams

### Common Job Scams in Malaysia:

1. **Fake Job Offers**:
   - If an employer offers a job **without an interview**, it‚Äôs likely a scam.
2. **Upfront Payments**:
   - Genuine companies **never ask for money** for job applications, processing, or visa sponsorship.
3. **Suspicious Emails**:
   - Emails from unofficial domains (e.g., **@gmail.com**, **@yahoo.com**) instead of company domains (e.g., **@companyname.com**) are usually scams.
4. **Too Good to Be True Offers**:
   - If the salary is **unrealistically high** for your experience, be cautious.
5. **Fake Recruitment Agencies**:
   - Always check if the recruiter is from a legitimate **registered agency**.

### Example of a Scam:

- A job offer from a **fake company** claims they are hiring you directly with a **high salary** but ask you to pay **RM 3,000 for visa processing**.
- **Reality**: No genuine company in Malaysia asks for money for work permits or visa processing.

## Avoiding Spam & Email Etiquette

- **Do not send bulk emails** to multiple employers at once.
- Customize your email for **each job application**.
- Avoid using **spammy words** like "Urgent Hiring", "Guaranteed Job", or "100% Placement" in your emails.
- Use a **professional email address** (e.g., [firstname.lastname@gmail.com](mailto\:firstname.lastname@gmail.com)).
- Always **proofread your email** before sending.
