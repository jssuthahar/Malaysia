# Job Search in Malaysia for Software Testers from India

## Question
**I am a software tester with 3+ years of experience. Currently, I'm looking for a job in Malaysia as I see many openings for tester roles on job portals. What is the best way to find a job from India? Can I come directly to Malaysia and look for a job there, or should I get a job offer from India before moving? If I come to Malaysia on a tourist visa, can I get a job? What type of visa is most efficient?**

## Answer

### 1. Best Way to Get a Job in Malaysia from India
   - Apply for jobs online from India and secure an offer first before moving.
   - Employers in Malaysia need to sponsor your **Employment Pass (EP)** or **Professional Visit Pass (PVP)** to legally work.
   - Research companies that hire testers and apply through their career portals.
   - Look for multinational companies, as they are more likely to sponsor visas for skilled professionals.

### 2. Can You Get a Job on a Tourist Visa?
   - **No, you cannot work in Malaysia on a tourist visa.**
   - It is illegal to work on a tourist visa, and companies prefer candidates who have work authorization.
   - If caught working on a tourist visa, you may face fines, deportation, or a ban from re-entering Malaysia.

### 5. Direct Application vs. Moving to Malaysia
   - The safest and most reliable way is to secure a job before moving.
