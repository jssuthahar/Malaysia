# Reference Visa (VDR – Visa With Reference)

## Overview
A **Reference Visa** is required when an individual needs prior approval from the **Immigration Department of Malaysia** before entering the country. This visa applies to:

- **Employment Pass holders** (for work purposes)
- **Dependent Pass holders** (for family members of Employment Pass holders)
- **Student Visa holders** (for study purposes)
- **Professional Visit Pass holders** (for short-term professional work)

## Reference Visa Process
1. **Employer or Sponsor Applies for Approval** – Your Malaysian employer submits an application to the **Immigration Department of Malaysia** for an Employment Pass.
2. **Approval Letter Issued** – Once approved, you receive a **Visa Approval Letter (VAL)**.
3. **Apply for a Visa at the Malaysian Embassy** – Using the VAL, you apply for the **Reference Visa** at the Malaysian embassy/consulate in your home country.
4. **Enter Malaysia and Get the Employment Pass Stamped** – Upon arrival, you complete the employment pass process.

## Can You Use a Reference Visa for Job Hunting?
❌ No, a Reference Visa is **not for job hunting**. It is only issued **after** you secure a job and your employer gets approval for your Employment Pass.
