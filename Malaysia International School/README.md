## 🌟 How to Choose the Best International School

Choosing the right school for your child is crucial! Here’s what to consider:  

✅ **Curriculum**: Match the curriculum with your child’s educational goals (e.g., British, IB, American, Indian).  
✅ **Language of Instruction**: Ensure the teaching language suits your child.  
✅ **Reputation**: Check school reviews and rankings.  
✅ **Location**: Select a school close to home or work for convenience.  
✅ **Fees**: Ensure tuition fees align with your budget.  
✅ **Facilities & Activities**: Look for extracurricular programs and modern facilities.  
✅ **Community**: Choose a school that aligns with your family’s values.  
✅ **Visit the School**: Go to the school’s website and find their WhatsApp number. Reach out to request information about their **Open Day**. Schools usually invite families to visit with their children, allowing you to explore the environment, interact with staff, and decide if it’s the right fit. You can also discuss and negotiate tuition fees during your visit.
