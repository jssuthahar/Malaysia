# 🇮🇳🛒 Buy Products from India and Get Them Delivered to Malaysia 🇲🇾

This guide explains step-by-step how to purchase products from Indian online stores and ship them directly to Malaysia using direct shipping options or parcel forwarding services.

## ✅ Option 1: Buy from Indian E-commerce Sites That Support International Shipping

### 🔹 Amazon India – [amazon.in](https://www.amazon.in)
- Some sellers offer international shipping.
- Use filters like **"Global Store"** or check product delivery info.
- Look for: “**This item can be shipped to your location**.”

### 🔹 Flipkart, Myntra, Ajio, Meesho, Snapdeal
- ❌ **Do NOT support international delivery directly.**
- ✅ Can be used with a **parcel forwarding service** (see below).

## ✅ Option 2: Use Indian Parcel Forwarding Services (Recommended)
