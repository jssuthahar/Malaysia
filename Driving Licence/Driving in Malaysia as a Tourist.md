- **Non-English License:** If your license is not in English or Malay, you must obtain:
  - An **International Driving Permit (IDP)**, OR
  - A **Certified Translation** of your license into English or Malay.

## Important Notes

- Ensure your license is **valid** for the entire duration of your stay.
- Follow local traffic laws to avoid fines or penalties.

## Conclusion
For short visits, an **International Driving Permit (IDP) is not mandatory** if you have a valid English driving license. However, having an IDP can help avoid any misunderstandings with authorities or rental agencies.
