# 🛣️ How Indian Citizens Can Get a Driving Licence in Malaysia

## 📌 Overview

If you are an **Indian citizen** planning to drive in Malaysia, the requirements differ based on your **length of stay**.

From **May 19, 2025**, Malaysia’s Road Transport Department (**JPJ**) stopped converting foreign licences (including Indian licences) into Malaysian ones, with limited exceptions.

---

## 🚗 1. Short-term Stay (< 12 months)

* You may drive using your **Indian Driving Licence**, **plus** an **International Driving Permit (IDP)**.
* Malaysia recognizes IDPs under the **1949 Geneva** and **1968 Vienna Conventions**.
* Without an IDP, your Indian licence **may not be accepted** by police or rental companies.

👉 **Recommendation:** Always carry an **IDP + Indian licence** for smooth driving.
